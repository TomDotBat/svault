# This repository and it's code is an absolute mess.

## Why open source?
The addon needs a lot of work. The codebase is messy, somewhat broken, and it's overall pretty featureless.
I'm making it available here in the hope that the community can work together to make it into something better.

## Why don't you fix it yourself?
I wrote this code years ago, it's hard to even look at it without vomiting.
I also don't have as much free time anymore, so gathering the time and motivation to do this is difficult.
